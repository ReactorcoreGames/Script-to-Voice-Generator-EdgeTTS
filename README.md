# Script to Voice Generator

Welcome to any script writing author out there!

You can convert formatted script files into fully voiced audio using Microsoft Edge-TTS,
with per-character voice settings, audio effects, and smart merged output.

## What You Need

**FFMPEG** — Required for audio effects and merging.

- Automatic installer (recommended): https://reactorcore.itch.io/ffmpeg-to-path-installer
- Manual install: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html — add to system PATH after installing.

**Python 3.x** — Required to run from source (not needed if using the compiled .exe). You use to build_exe.bat to build the whole thing in a single click.

## What It Does

Script to Voice Generator reads a formatted `.txt` or `.md` script file and:

- Converts each dialogue line to speech using Edge-TTS (300+ voices).
- Saves individual clips for each line — both clean (TTS only) and effects-processed.
- Merges all clips into a single audio file, with smart pauses based on punctuation.
- Produces both a raw merge and a loudness-normalized merge.
- Generates a reference sheet listing every clip filename and its spoken text.

Multiple speakers are supported. Each speaker gets their own voice, pitch, speed,
and audio effects settings, stored in `character_profiles.json` so they're remembered
between sessions.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Write or prepare a script file

Scripts are `.txt` or `.md` files. Each spoken line uses the format:

```
SpeakerID: Dialogue text goes here.
```

Example:

```
# My Short Film

Alex: Hey, are you okay?
Jordan: Yeah, I'm fine. [sighs] Just tired.
(1.0s)
Alex: You sure? You look pale.
Jordan: I said I'm fine.
```

See **Script Format** below for full syntax details.

### 2. Load the script (Tab 1)

1. Launch the program and click **Open Script File**.
2. The parser checks for formatting errors and lists them in the log.
3. Fix any errors in your text editor and click **Reload Script**.
4. When the parse log shows no errors, click **Continue →**.

### 3. Configure voices (Tab 2)

Each detected speaker gets a panel with:

- **Voice** — Choose from Edge-TTS voices. Use the filter checkbox to show only
  English voices, or uncheck it for all languages.
- **Pitch** — Deep / Normal / High / Custom preset.
- **Speed** — Percentage adjustment.
- **Level** — 5–100% relative volume. 100% = full normalized output (default). Reduce to make a speaker quieter in the mix.
- **Yell Impact** — Slows down single-word exclamatory lines (e.g. WOW!). (with monotone edge-tts voices it makes such single word lines sound more emphasized, impactful.)
- **Audio Effects** — Radio, Reverb, Distortion, Telephone, Robot Voice, Cheap Mic.
  Each has Off / Mild / Medium / Strong levels.

Use **Test Voice** to generate a quick preview clip and hear the settings immediately.

Settings auto-save to `character_profiles.json` on every change, so known speakers
are recalled automatically next session.

### 4. Generate (Tab 3)

1. Enter a **Project Name** (used as a filename prefix, 20 chars max).
2. Choose an **Output Folder**.
3. Click **Generate All** and confirm.

The generation log shows progress. When done, all files appear in the output folder:

```
output_folder/
├── clips_clean/          ← Raw TTS clips (no FFMPEG effects)
│   └── project_0001_Speaker_line-text.mp3
├── clips_effect/         ← Effects-processed clips
│   └── project_0001_Speaker_line-text.mp3
├── !project_merged_pure.mp3        ← Merged audio, no normalization
├── !project_merged_loudnorm.mp3    ← Merged audio, loudness-normalized
└── project_reference.txt           ← Line-by-line reference sheet
```

---

## Script Format

### Dialogue lines

```
SpeakerID: Spoken text goes here.
```

- SpeakerID must be 20 characters or fewer. Allowed: letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, underscores.
- All text after the first colon is spoken. Additional colons in the line are fine.
- Lines over 500 characters throw a parse error.

### Headings

```
# Scene title
## Sub-scene
```

Treated as metadata. Sets the script title. Not voiced.

### Comments

```
// This is a comment
/* Multi-line
   comment */
```

Not voiced. Useful for stage directions, notes, or commented-out listener responses.

### Pauses

```
(1.5s)
(pause 2.0)
(0.8)
```

Any line that is only parentheses containing a number inserts a silent pause in the
merged audio. The number is in seconds.

### Sound effects

```
{play filename.mp3, c1, loop}
{stop c1}
{stop all}
{play explosion.wav, once}
```

Sound effect events are placed in the merge timeline at the correct position.
Sound effect files must exist in the SFX folder specified in Tab 2.

**Note:** If a sound effect is the very last item in your script, it needs a pause after it to actually be heard in the merged audio. 
Add a `(pause)` line equal to or longer than the sound effect's duration immediately after the `{play}` line. Without it, the base audio ends at the same moment the SFX starts, and the SFX gets cut off.

Like this:

```
Rei: Signing off.
{play cloth.wav, c1, once}
(2.0s)
```

**Supported formats** — Any audio format FFMPEG can read: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.flac`, `.aac`, `.m4a`, and others.
The filename in your script must match the actual file exactly (including extension).

**File size and length** — No enforced limit. FFMPEG loads each SFX file into the mix at its playback position.
Very large or very long SFX files will increase merge time and output file size, but will not cause errors on their own.
Loop-mode SFX (`loop`) are automatically trimmed at the matching `{stop}` event, so file length only matters for `once` mode plays.

### Inline notation

- [brackets] on a dialogue line are stripped before TTS — use for performance notes,
  sound effect cues, or character direction for human voice actors.
- **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~ are stripped before TTS (markdown formatting).
- // after dialogue text starts an inline comment; everything after it is stripped.

## Settings Tab (Tab 4)

**Merged Audio Pauses** — Adjust the pause duration added after each punctuation type
(period, comma, exclamation, question, hyphen, ellipsis, etc.).

**Contextual Modifiers** — Fine-tune how pause lengths are modified by context:
speaker changes, short lines, long lines, inner thought padding, etc.

**Inner Thoughts Effect** — Choose from Whisper, Dreamlike, Dissociated presets
or configure custom highpass/lowpass/echo parameters for the inner thought audio filter.

## Audio Effects Reference

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Radio Filter | Walkie-talkie / comms radio effect. Bandpass + phaser + compression. |
| Reverb | Spatial depth. Configurable echo chains. |
| Distortion | Aggressive, gritty clipping and bit crushing. |
| Telephone | Lo-fi compressed sound. Narrow bandpass + bit crushing. |
| Robot Voice | Ring modulator for mechanical / robotic character. |
| Cheap Mic | Degraded quality, poor recording simulation. |
| Underwater | Muffled, wet, submerged sound. Lowpass + flanger. |
| Megaphone | Projected bullhorn. Treble-boosted, punchy, bandpassed. |
| Worn Tape | VHS/cassette degradation. Wow-flutter, lo-fi analog warble. |
| Intercom | Hallway speaker box. Flat, compressed, confined. Adds crackling static noise. |
| Alien Voice | Non-human vocal quality. Three variants: Insectoid, Dimensional, Warble. |
| Cave | Physical stone space reverb. Three variants: Tunnel, Cave, Abyss. |

Most effects have Off / Mild / Medium / Strong presets. Alien and Cave use named variants instead. Effects are combinable.

## Tips

- **Write for TTS.** Edge-TTS pronounces non-word vocalizations letter by letter —
  "grr" becomes "gee arr arr". Use real words instead:
  - Instead of "ugh" → "oh", "gosh", "nah"
  - Instead of "grr" → "gah", "bah", "come on"
  - Instead of "hnng" → "huh", "nope", "done"

- **Test each voice** before generating everything. The Test Voice button in Tab 2
  saves a preview clip and opens it immediately.

- **Cheap Mic** at Mild is a subtle effect that adds a hint of realism to otherwise
  very clean TTS voices. Worth trying as a default.

- **Prompt templates** — The `!docs/prompt_templates/` folder has templates for using AI
  chatbots to write scripts or generate voice line banks. Open them in any text editor.

## Troubleshooting

**FFMPEG not found** — Install FFMPEG and make sure it is in your system PATH.
Use the automatic installer at https://reactorcore.itch.io/ffmpeg-to-path-installer
then restart the program.

**Parse errors on load** — The parse log in Tab 1 lists every error with line numbers.
Fix them in your text editor and click Reload Script.

**Voice too quiet** — The post-effects normalization pass ensures consistent loudness.
If a speaker still sounds quiet relative to others, their Level slider may be below 100%.

**Missing voice lines in output** — Check the generation log in Tab 3 for per-line
errors. A missing voice assignment or an FFMPEG issue on a specific line will be noted.

**Test Voice not opening** — The file is saved to output_test/ in the program folder.
Open it manually if the auto-open fails.
